# ExternalBrowser

An overlay like browser that functions by allowing a user to view a browser-window upon pressing the RIGHT-ALT hotkey. (will be customizable later down the line)

Currently this only works with games that utilize BORDERLESS WINDOWS, otherwise it'll cause the game to tab out - which defeats the purpose of the browser.
